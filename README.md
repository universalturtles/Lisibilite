# Lisibilite
Repo for maintaining the code base for hybrid readability index calculation application.
It is called Lisibilite - meaning Readability in French.

# Why this name?
Because, it sounded fun!


# Run in Dev Mode
## Prereq
1. Miniconda

## Install Lisbilite
1. Install Conda
	```
	conda create --name lisibilite python=3
	```
2. Activate Conda
	```
	conda activate lisibilite
	```

3. Install Lisibilite CLI
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python setup.py install
	```

4. Start Django Server
	```
	export DEBUG="True"

# MVP

* A Web UI where a user can paste a block of text and when clicked submit gives back the readability scores
> The readability scores should be easily understandable and a graph possibly
> Display the text is suitable for what age
* An API that can be access to post a text and gives back a readability score JSON
> Should have token access and should be rate limited
* Users should be able to sign - up and see history of submitted text after sign - in

# First Thoughts

* An elegant responsive web application where the user can upload a Doc, PDF or text file and view the readability metrics.
* A user should be able to download a well - formatted report in PDF with a custom headline and the metrics of the uploaded document
* The user should be able to easily understand the interpretation of the metrics with well - formed graphs / charts
* The application should also provide metrics such as the number of words, number of sentences, and number of paragraphs
> The user should have the option to ignore titles, sub - headings, figure captions, table captions, references etc
* There should be support for HATEOAS, HAL compliant fine - grained ReST APIs for all the above features.
> The APIs should be secured by API Tokens(The generation of API tokens for users can be made self - service on a later stage. Initially it will be on request)

# Based on Additional Brain Storming
- Word Counts with an ability to filter out articles, titles, figures, tables, references etc., (Academic)
- Ability to create readability reports with custom title and sections
*Some sections in the report can be*
- Lisibilite Readability Graph - Something in my mind
- Word Density Analysis
- Noun Phrase / Verb Phrase Composition Analysis
- And one day - some day - Summary / Abstract of the text
- Text Sentiment - someday - one day
- Spelling Errors
- An API for programmatic access to our service(**No one has given it as such**)
- Initially, it will be very much rate limited. We can see how we can extend it.
- One day, someday, we can start supporting other languages - **that will be yoyo**
- I believe we must give the facility of user accounts. We must also categorize some of our features as "Premium", for which they will have to pay: P(Of course all these would be after we get enough user traffic). That would also give us scope for some user - specific analytics.
* The service should be available as MS Word Plugin
* The service should be available as a LibreOffice Plugin
* The service should be available as a responsive cross - platform application server over the cloud.
